# Changelog

## 1.0.2

* Removed the need to change the System-Settings->Effect settings to "none" for the Minimize/Unminimize options. This is now accomplished by intercepting a cinnamon API and forcing it to disable the Cinnamon Minimize/Unminimize effects while the MagicLamp extension is enabled.
* Fixed some minor typos in the README.

## 1.0.1

* Initial version committed to cinnamon spices
