# Blur Overview

Allows you to blur, colorize and adjust the dimming of the overview's background (window selection screen)

## What is the Overview?

The Overview shows you all the windows on the workspace and it can be activated in two ways:

1. By using the "Show the window selection screen" hotkey. By default the hotkey is: Ctrl+Alt+Down.
2. Moving the mouse pointer to the "Show all windows" Hot Corner. By default that is the top-left of the screen.

## Requirements

For the version 2.0.0 changes (Gaussian blur effect and color blending) you need to be running Cinnamon 6.0 or better (i.e Mint 21.3 or better).

## Features

Customize the Overview's background by:

1. Adding a Simple or an adjustable intensity Gaussian blur effect.
2. Adjust the dimming from 0 to 100%.
3. Blend a color into the background to give it a custom hue.

## Installation

1. Right click on the cinnamon panel and click "System Settings"
2. Click on the "Extensions" icon under the "Preferences" category
3. Click the "Download" tab and then click the "Blur Overview" entry
4. Click the "Install" button on the right and then return to the "Manage" tab
5. Select the new "Blur Overview" entry and then click the "+" button at the bottom of the window
