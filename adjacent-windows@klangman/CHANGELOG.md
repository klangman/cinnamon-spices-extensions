# Changelog

## 1.1.0

* Added two configuration options to offer some advanced controls over how the algorithm works when using the "Closest with a visible corner" window selection option. These options might help some people achieve a window selection behaviour that is more to their liking.
* Moved files to a 5.4 directory as an added protection ensuring that the extension is only used in Cinnamon 5.4 or higher.
* Fixed some typos in the README.md

## 1.0.0
