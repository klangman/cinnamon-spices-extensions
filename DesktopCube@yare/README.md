# Desktop Cube

Compiz Cube-like animation for workspace switching

Using the standard workspace switching hotkeys Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right will show a rotating cube with the workspaces on the cube faces as the workspace switching animation.

# Known Issues

On the two machines I have tested with (Cinnamon 6+), the Cube animation does not seem to animate every well unless I set the pullaway setting value to a large number (i.e 0.3+). Even then I see some flashing some times or a complete failure to animate on occasion. I am not sure what's causing it but it happens on a Intel and a AMD GPU setup so I doubt it's a driver issue. I don't see the same issue using very old Mint versions in a Virtual Machine.
